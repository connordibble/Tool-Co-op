    <h3>The Car Project</h3>
    <p>"All of our tools were stolen by the gang down the street along with our money. We had to get it back the only way
      we knew possible: <b>By racing</b>. We had some old junk cars that were pretty beat up, and were in need of the tools
      necessary to fix them up. That's when we found out the Tool Shed had gotten some new software that we could conveniently
      use to rent some tools while ours were stolen. We were able to rent these tools for a cheap price, fix up our cars,
      and finally challenge the gang down the street to a race to win all our stuff back. The race was close, our friend
      Dom was the driver and he said if it weren't for the tools provided that he would have lost the race, but in the end
      everything was returned back to normal thanks to the Tool Shed."</p>

    <h3>The Shed Project</h3>
    <p>"I have wanted to build a shed in my backyard for the last 4 or 5 years. I have been saving up money and getting
      some material needed to build it for quite some time now but when I started my project I realized the level that I
      had was much to small and a 4 foot level was required to make sure the shed was built properly. Thankfully I had a
      friend recommend Tool Shed to me because buying a 4 foot level for myself just wasn't very practicle. I was able to
      rent from the Tool Shed for a very reasonable price and now I have the dream shed that I have been wishing for, for
      the past 5 years."</p>

    <h3>The Deck Project</h3>
    <p>"My wife has nagged me for the past 8 years to do something to pretty up the backyard. I've never been the handyman
      myself, nor have I had the equipment to do any sort of remodeling. Thanks to the Tool Shed, I was able to rent the
      tools I needed for as long as I needed them -- at a bargain price too! Huge shoutouts to Joe and his crew, they've
      made this project a breeze. I would highly recommend you look into their services before burning your cash on overpriced
      hardware chains."</p>
