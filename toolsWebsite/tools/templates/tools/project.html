    <h3>The Car Project</h3>
    <p>"All of our tools were stolen by the gang down the street along with our money. We had to get it back the only way we knew possible: <b>By racing</b>. We had some old junk cars that were pretty beat up, and were in need of the tools necessary to fix them up. That's when we found out the Tool Shed had gotten some new software that we could conveniently use to rent some tools while ours were stolen. We were able to rent these tools for a cheap price, fix up our cars, and finally challenge the gang down the street to a race to win all our stuff back. The race was close, our friend Dom was the driver and he said if it weren't for the tools provided that he would have lost the race, but in the end everything was returned back to normal thanks to the Tool Shed."</p>
